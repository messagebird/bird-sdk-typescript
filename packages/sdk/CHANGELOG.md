# Changelog

## 0.26.0

- **Breaking:** `carrier` and `mcc_mnc` are omitted from `sms.sent`, `sms.delivered` and `sms.received` webhook payloads when the carrier reports none, instead of arriving as `null`; `subject` on `sms.received` behaves the same way. They are now optional rather than required, so a typed field changes to a pointer or an optional — check for absence where you checked for `null`. This matches how the message resource has always reported the same fields.
- `sms.accepted` now carries `segments`, the segment breakdown the send is billed on, so a webhook-only integration can explain the `cost` on the same event instead of fetching the message to reconcile a charge.
- Subscribe to `sms.received` to be pushed inbound SMS instead of polling for it. The payload carries the message body, its segment breakdown, both numbers, and the sending operator where the carrier reports one; a `STOP` arrives as an ordinary received message and is yours to act on.

## 0.25.1

- A verification attempt can now report `delivery_timeout` as its failure reason, meaning no delivery confirmation arrived before the channel's timeout and the verification failed over to the next channel.

## 0.25.0

- **Breaking:** an SMS error `code` is now an open enum, so a reason added by a newer server type-checks instead of being rejected; a `switch` over `SmsErrorCode` that relied on the set being closed needs a `default` branch. The values known at this version are exported as `SMSErrorCode`.
- The `sms.expired` webhook payload now carries `error`, the same failure detail the other terminal SMS events carry: a Bird-stable `code`, a `description`, and the provider's `carrier_error_code` when it sent one.
- **Breaking:** An email template reads the recipient's contact record through `bird.contact.<attribute>` and the unsubscribe link through `bird.unsubscribe_url`. Rewrite a template that uses any other spelling for those values and republish it.
- **Breaking:** A send by template must supply a value for every parameter its template uses, and a parameter name must be a single word. A send that omits one is rejected rather than delivered with a blank in place of the value.
- **Breaking:** A `marketing` template has to place `bird.unsubscribe_url` in its body to publish, in every language it carries. The token stands on its own: no filters, not inside an `{% if %}` or `{% for %}` block, and not in the subject. Where a language has both an HTML and a text body, the HTML one has to carry it.
- `bird` is now the only name you cannot use for a parameter, so `contact`, `unsubscribe_url` and `first_name` are all available.
- Listing calls now accepts in-flight and final statuses together in one `status` filter and returns them as a single page, where mixing them used to be rejected.
- **Breaking:** a WhatsApp template parameter's `text` is now optional and should be read as nullable. It carries a value only on a `text` parameter, and a parameter of any other kind carries its value in the field named for that kind.
- Template parameters can now describe more than text. `type` accepts `image`, `video`, `gif`, `document` and `location` alongside `text`: `image`, `video`, `gif` and `document` carry a media header's file in `url`, and `location` carries a location header's point in `location`. A parameter's kind names only the field its value travels in — a coupon button's code is a plain string, so it is still a `text` parameter (`{"type":"text","text":"LUCAS25"}`), the same shape the code was authored under. A `carousel` component carries its values per card, in `cards[]`, one entry per card in the order the template was approved with.
- Three WhatsApp field descriptions now match what the API does. Omitting a template send's `language` sends the template's default language rather than returning a `422`; `received` is documented as an inbound message's status rather than as reserved; and a WhatsApp message's `cost` explains that an inbound message is never priced.

## 0.24.0

- Listing contacts gains an `identifier` filter (`email` or `phone`), and each contact now includes its `audiences`.
- **Breaking:** an SMS message's `carrier` and `mcc_mnc` are omitted rather than `null` when Bird does not have them; replace a `=== null` check on either with an `undefined` or falsy one.
- **Breaking:** an SMS event's `carrier` and `mcc_mnc` are omitted rather than `null` before the carrier is identified; replace a `=== null` check on either with an `undefined` or falsy one.
- **Breaking:** an SMS message's `text` is now optional — a message you sent always carries one, but a received message may not. Handle its absence rather than assuming every message has a body.
- Every `sms.*` webhook payload now carries `cost`, split into `transaction_amount` and `passthrough_amount` over one currency. The figure is as of that event, and the components are named so a subscriber merges them per component rather than replacing the object, since webhook delivery is not ordered.
- Verify gains a next-channel action: when a recipient reports the passcode never arrived, send a fresh one on the next channel in the verification's plan without waiting out the resend cooldown. Identify the verification by the same recipient you started it with, as with a check — there is still no id to store. Every passcode already sent stays valid, so a late arrival can still be checked. Available as `verify.verifications.nextChannel` / `NextChannel` / `next_channel` / `nextChannel` on the TypeScript, Go, Python, and PHP SDKs, `bird verify verifications next-channel` on the CLI, and the `verify_verifications_next_channel` MCP tool. A verification whose channel plan is exhausted answers `422 NoNextChannel`.
- Add a `voice` resource for reading the call log: list the workspace's calls with the dashboard's filters, and fetch one call at any point in its lifecycle.
- A voice call now reports `actor`, the API key or user that placed it. It is absent on calls that ended before Bird began recording it, and on any call your trunk admitted by source IP address, since that path carries no credential to identify a caller.
- A WhatsApp message's `cost` now names its components, matching SMS: `transaction_amount` is what Bird charged to send the message, and `passthrough_amount` is reserved for third-party fees. `amount` remains the total.
- Message reads on SMS and WhatsApp are now bounded to a 30-day retention window: a `created_after` earlier than the bound is raised to it rather than returning a silently truncated page, and a message older than the window is not retrievable by id.
- The create-verification docs no longer name SMS as the phone channel: a phone recipient is verified over the phone channels enabled for its destination country, in that country's configured order.

## 0.23.0

- An SMS message's `cost` now names its components: `transaction_amount` is what Bird charged to carry the message, and `passthrough_amount` is reserved for third-party fees such as US 10DLC carrier surcharges. `amount` remains the total.

## 0.22.0

- Listing WhatsApp messages gains a `category` filter, matching the equivalent filter on SMS and email messages.

## 0.21.2

- The Realtime app list's `sort` filter is now a named type, `RealtimeAppSortField` (`created_at` | `name`), instead of a bare string, and the Realtime app `name` field carries a description. No method or signature changes.

## 0.21.1

- Republish. Versions 0.17.0 through 0.21.0 never reached npm, so 0.16.0 was the newest version installable from the registry; this release carries every change they made, listed in the 0.17.0 through 0.21.0 entries below.

## 0.21.0

- **Breaking:** three Realtime type names change. A per-call credential override moves onto the request options as `credentials`, keyed by security scheme: `{ credentials: { RealtimeKey, RealtimeSecret } }` replaces `{ key, secret }`, and `RealtimeRequestOptions` is gone with it. `RealtimeBatchPublishParams` is now `RealtimePublishBatchParams`, and `RealtimeChannelsListQuery` is now `RealtimeChannelListQuery`. Client-level `realtime: { key, secret }` and every method signature are unchanged.
- Batch contact upserts now match each entry automatically on every identifier it carries (email, phone, or external_id), refusing entries whose identifiers belong to more than one contact; `match_on` (`email`, `phone`, or `external_id`) forces a single key. Result items echo what each entry supplied under a nested `entry` object (`email`, `phone`, `external_id`, null where absent, never the contact's current state), plus a top-level `matched_on` naming which identifier matched, null for created rows.
- Failed rows in a batch contact upsert carry the specific error `code` (for example `E04058`, ambiguous match, versus `E04055`, phone taken) alongside `type` and `message`, so a sync can branch on which conflict it hit.
- **Breaking (0.x):** `Contact.channels` is removed: the field restated which identifiers are set under a reachability claim the platform cannot back. Read `email`/`phone` presence directly.
- **Breaking (0.x):** `Contact.email` is now `string | null`: a contact may be identified by an E.164 phone number instead of, or as well as, an email address. Contacts gain `phone` and the contact list gains an exact `phone` filter.
- Filter WhatsApp messages by `direction`. The unfiltered list returns the whole conversation, so `direction` narrows it to what you sent or what the contact sent you.

## 0.20.0

- Voice call webhook payloads name the two parties from and to, replacing src_number and dst_number. A handler reading those fields on voice_call.initiated, voice_call.answered or voice_call.ended must rename them; every other field is unchanged.
- WhatsApp and SMS template `language` fields now take a BCP-47 tag (for example `pt-BR`); Meta's underscore form (`pt_BR`) is still accepted as an input alias but is no longer echoed back. WhatsApp template sends can now also address a template by `id`, as an alternative to `slug`: pass `template: { id: "wat_…" }` instead of `template: { slug: … }` (supply exactly one).
- WhatsApp send: the `to` field now accepts a business-scoped user ID as well as an E.164 phone number, so you can message a WhatsApp user whose phone number you do not have. One-time-passcode templates still require a phone number and return `422 WhatsAppRecipientNotSupportedForTemplate` when sent to a business-scoped user ID.

## 0.19.1

- The five bespoke delete-blocked error codes (IPPoolContainsIPs, DomainHasMailboxes, AudienceInUse, TCRBrandHasCampaigns, ConfigurationInUse) are retired in favor of the single E01028 ResourceInUse. domains.delete may now return a 409 error, typed on DeleteDomainErrors, when the domain still has mailboxes bound to it.

## 0.19.0

- Add a `datetime` contact property type: an RFC 3339 timestamp with an explicit offset.
- Add Realtime app management: `apps`, `keys`, and `regions`, now part of the public API.
- Add realtime.members.send: deliver an event to every connection one member holds, addressing the person rather than a channel.
- Add the `connection_count_events` app setting to the Realtime app types.
- Listing contacts gains an `include_total` flag for a total count, and `q` now matches first and last name as well as email.
- WhatsApp `rejected` now covers every refusal before transmit, not only a suppressed recipient: a charge decline (insufficient wallet balance, unpriced destination) and an undeliverable recipient report `status: rejected` with a `whatsapp.rejected` timeline event instead of `failed`. `whatsapp.rejected` is also now published on the message-events enum.
- **Breaking:** a WhatsApp send against a template that declares named parameters must now name every parameter, matched as a set, so order no longer matters; an unnamed, misnamed, duplicated, or missing name returns `422 WhatsAppTemplateParameterMismatch`. `bird_otp` stays positional: its values go in `{{n}}` order and must carry no name. Unnamed values were previously matched by position and could render the wrong content while reporting success, so sends made against these templates before this release are worth re-checking.
- A parameter that arrived with no description now carries the one its field documents.
- Clarify the email broadcast and template descriptions, including the errors each operation can return.
- Correct the `parameters` field description for an inline send.
- Document that an authentication-category message returns a redacted body.
- Template variables now report a `sensitive` flag showing whether the value is redacted before storage.

## 0.18.1

- Point the package repository and issue URLs at the renamed bird-sdk-typescript mirror.

## 0.18.0

- Open-enum fields now carry their known values: reading one offers the values the API can send, and a value added by a newer server still decodes.

## 0.17.0

- Export the known values of every open enum (EmailEventType, VerificationChannel, WhatsAppErrorCode and the rest) as constants, so an open enum is no longer a bare string with its values buried in prose.
- Email message reads and send responses now report `requested_language` and `resolved_language`.
- Email message reads and send responses now report `template_id` and `template_version_id`. A template's live version changes each time you submit it, so the version is what identifies the wording a message was actually delivered with, and the two together fetch that content back.
- Passcode attempts can report `channel_disabled`, meaning Bird has temporarily stopped sending over that channel and the verification moved on to the next one.

## 0.16.0

- **Breaking:** a WhatsApp send addresses its template by `slug` (previously `name`), and a WhatsApp message read echoes `template.slug` (previously `template.name`). Templates carry the slug as their permanent handle; the display name is cosmetic and never affects sending.

## 0.15.0

- Email message reads now report the message as delivered. For a send that used a template, `subject` and the bodies from the message-content endpoint previously returned the template source, tokens and all, which is content no recipient received; they now return that source with the send's substitution values applied. The values themselves are exposed as a new `parameters` field so the inputs stay visible beside the result. Sends that supplied their content inline are unaffected.
- Nest mailboxes and threads under email, matching the URL and the CLI/MCP names. bird.mailbox becomes bird.email.mailboxes, bird.mailboxThread becomes bird.email.threads, bird.mailboxThreadMessage becomes bird.email.threads.messages, bird.mailboxReceiveRule becomes bird.email.mailboxes.receiveRules, and mailbox.compose becomes email.mailboxes.messages.create. Exported param and query types are renamed to match.
- Document that a template's `language_source_required` setting makes the send block's `language` mandatory.
- Documented how category resolves on a send-by-template: omitting it takes the template's own classification, and setting it always overrides the template.

## 0.14.0

- Add an optional `language` to the email template send block, selecting which of the template's languages to send. The template's `on_missing_language` decides whether an unstocked language falls back or is rejected.
- `mailbox.update` now accepts the `confirm` query parameter (required when lowering `retention_tier`) as a third argument; it was previously unreachable.
- Add the `mailbox` resource: `list`, `create`, `get`, `stats`, `labels`, `restore`, `resume`, and `delete`.
- **Go:** the create body's `ReceivePolicy` and `RetentionTier` are now the typed `MailboxCreateReceivePolicy` / `MailboxCreateRetentionTier` enums instead of plain strings.
- **TypeScript:** a write whose body has no required field now defaults its params to `{}`, so `bird.mailbox.create()`, `bird.audiences.update(id)`, and `bird.domains.update(id)` are callable without a body; the unused `MailboxList` envelope export is removed.
- Add the `mailbox_thread_message` reads: `list`, `get`, `body`, and `attachments`.
- **Python:** the `client.mailbox_thread.messages` nested accessor is replaced by the top-level `client.mailbox_thread_message` (matching Go and TypeScript).
- **TypeScript:** the unused `EmailThreadMessageList` export is removed.
- Add the `mailbox_thread` reads (`list`, `get`) and `delete`.
- **Go (breaking, 0.x):** `MailboxThreadService.Delete` takes `MailboxThreadDeleteParams{Permanent bool}` instead of a positional `permanent bool`.
- **TypeScript:** `mailboxThread.delete` accepts an optional `MailboxThreadDeleteQuery`; the unused `EmailThreadList` export is removed.
- **Python:** `mailbox_thread.delete` accepts a `permanent` keyword.
- Add the `mailbox_receive_rule` resource: `list`, `create`, and `delete`.
- **Go:** the create body's `Action` is now the typed `ReceiveRuleCreateAction` enum instead of a plain string.
- **Python:** the `client.mailbox.receive_rules` nested accessor is replaced by the top-level `client.mailbox_receive_rule` (matching Go and TypeScript).
- **TypeScript:** the unused `ReceiveRuleList` export is removed.
- Add the SMS reads `get` and `list`; `list` now accepts a `tag` filter.
- Add the WhatsApp reads `get`, `list`, and `list_events`; `list` now accepts a `tag` filter.
- **Breaking (0.x):** `VerificationCreateParams` / `VerificationCheckParams` are renamed `VerifyVerificationsCreateParams` / `VerifyVerificationsCheckParams`; the request bodies are unchanged.
- WhatsApp messages now return `cost`, the amount charged for the message.
- The email template send block addresses a stored template by `slug` (previously `name`). Templates carry the slug as their permanent handle plus a separate free-text display `name`.
- The realtime.* webhook event type constants are no longer exported. Realtime webhooks are created and managed in the Bird dashboard.
- **Breaking:** remove the WhatsApp templates-list surface — `bird whatsapp templates list`, the `whatsapp_templates_list` MCP tool, and `whatsappTemplates.list` / `WhatsappTemplates.List` / `whatsapp_templates.list` in the TypeScript, Go, and Python SDKs. WhatsApp is still in preview and the templates contract is being reshaped for localisation; templates return to the public and command audiences at GA in the new shape.
- Add the `soft_bounce` verification attempt failure reason (open enum) for transient email bounces.
- Clarified the VoiceCallStatus documentation: ringing and in_progress describe a call that is still up, rather than values held back for a future feature.
- SMS alphanumeric sender IDs now allow dashes and underscores alongside letters, digits, and spaces, and must contain at least one letter with no separator at either end. A digits-only value is a long code or short code, and is no longer accepted as a sender ID.
- The TypeScript SDK now exports `EmailMessageCategory` as a named type instead of an inline union.
- `mailbox_thread_message.reply` now accepts the full message body, including structured `tags` (`{name, value}`) and `attachments`. In Go, `ReplyAll` is now `*bool` so an explicit `false` reaches the wire.
- `contact-properties` `create` and `update`: the fallback value is typed as any JSON value, and the property type is the named `ContactPropertyType`.
- `contacts.update`: the `Email` field is now a plain string rather than a pointer.
- Add the email read methods: `get`, `list`, and `cancel`.
- `EmailThreadMessageReplyRequest` gains an optional `attachments` field, matching the compose and direct-send surfaces.
- The SMS-template list filters carry their named enum types from the spec (TemplateScope, SMSMessageCategory) instead of inline unions.
- The stats trend-grain, message direction, and email status read filters are now typed rather than plain strings, so each carries the values it accepts.

## 0.13.0

- Add Realtime data-plane methods: publish, batch publish, channel list/get/members, and member disconnect.
- Add the audiences resource. `AudienceContactsQuery` is now `AudienceListContactsQuery` (matches `listContacts`).
- Add the domains resource: create, read, update, delete, and verify.
- Add `verify.*` webhook event types and payloads.
- Internal improvements.

## 0.12.2

- The verification terminal reason is now the named type `VerificationTerminalReason`, carrying its known values, rather than a bare string.
- Internal improvements.
- Stats `period.grain` is now typed as a shared `StatsGrain` (`day` | `hour`) instead of a plain string. No wire or behavioural change.

## 0.12.1

- Resource and package docstrings now describe behavior only.

## 0.12.0

- Agent mailboxes (inbox.ai): bird.mailbox, bird.mailboxReceiveRule, bird.mailboxThread, bird.mailboxThreadMessage
- Internal improvements.

## 0.11.0

- Add the `rejected` WhatsApp message delivery status, returned when the recipient is on the workspace's suppression list.
- Add the `whatsapp.rejected` webhook event, delivered when Bird rejects a WhatsApp message before sending because the recipient is on the workspace's suppression list.
- Rename voice call webhook event types from voice.call.* to voice_call.* (single-dot resource convention; events were never emitted, so no delivered payload changes)

## 0.10.1

- Message list filters: created_after is an inclusive lower bound and created_before is now an exclusive upper bound.

## 0.10.0

- Add sms.tfn_verification webhook event types
- Add email statistics reads under `email.stats`: the period summary, the daily and hourly time series, and the dimension breakdowns (by tag, category, sending IP, sending domain, recipient domain, mailbox provider, mailbox-provider region, template, location, client, bounce code, complaint type, and broadcast).
- **Breaking:** the Realtime webhook event type `realtime.subscription_count` is now `realtime.connection_count`, matching Bird's Realtime vocabulary (per channel it counts connections — one connection cannot subscribe twice). Realtime is in early access; the old event type had no GA consumers.
- No functional change: embedded schema metadata now carries pinned enum constant names
- Operations and fields now document their units, defaults, omission behavior, and per-value status meanings. Several descriptions were corrected to match actual behavior, including engagement-rate denominators, suppression prefix matching, and stored-content retention.
- Internal improvements.
- WhatsApp templates: create and list/get a workspace's own message templates. Reads now include a template id and an optional description; create takes a name, category, components, a WhatsApp language code, and an optional description; sending gained a named parameter name for named-parameter templates. Additive; no breaking change.

## 0.9.3

- Suppressions: `reason`, `origin`, and `applies_to` are now documented as growing vocabularies (open enums on the wire) — `origin` gained `unsubscribe_link`, a suppression created by the recipient through Bird's hosted unsubscribe page or its one-click link. Treat unknown values as informational rather than rejecting the record. Additive; no breaking change.

## 0.9.2

- Add voice call-event webhook types: `voice.call.initiated`, `voice.call.answered`, and `voice.call.ended` are now recognized event types with typed payloads. Additive; no breaking change.

## 0.9.1

- Documentation search results now carry a `slug`, and a new `DocsPage` type describes a documentation page's full Markdown. Additive wire types for the public docs read/search operations; no new SDK method.

## 0.9.0

- **Breaking:** WhatsApp message reads now return `from` and `to` (each a phone number and/or business-scoped user ID) in place of `business` and `contact`, matching the SMS/email convention.

## 0.8.5

- Verify: `whatsapp` is now a recognized verification channel — the open `channel` enum gained `whatsapp`, and a country route's per-channel settings accept a `whatsapp` key. Additive; no breaking change.

## 0.8.4

- **Breaking:** the contact list free-text filter is now `q` (was `search`), matching the API's renamed query parameter. Update `contacts.list({ search })` to `contacts.list({ q })`.

## 0.8.3

- Documentation clarifications.

## 0.8.2

- Received messages and the `email.received` event now carry `authentication` (`pass`/`fail`/`unknown`), a single summary of sender authentication; treat `unknown` as not verified. The `spf_pass`/`dkim_pass`/`dmarc_pass` fields remain. Additive; no breaking change.

## 0.8.1

- Add the WhatsApp webhook event types: `whatsapp.accepted`, `whatsapp.sent`, `whatsapp.delivered`, `whatsapp.read`, and `whatsapp.failed`. Additive; no breaking change.

## 0.8.0

- Add the sending domains collection: `domains.create`, `.get`, `.list`, `.update`, `.delete`, and `.verify`. Register a sending domain, publish the DNS records it returns, then verify until it is usable as a sender. Requires an API key with the `domains` scope.

## 0.7.6

- Clarify that `DocsSearchResult.url` and `.doc_url` are absolute URLs, matching `.markdown_url` and the API's actual output. Documentation only; no API or behavior change.

## 0.7.5

- Add the Realtime webhook event types: `realtime.cache_channels`, `realtime.channel_existence`, `realtime.client_events`, `realtime.presence`, and `realtime.subscription_count`. Additive; no breaking change.

## 0.7.4

- Contacts now carry `channels` (the channels a contact can be reached on) and audience members carry the `audiences` they belong to. Listing an audience's contacts gains an optional `search` filter (email substring). Additive response fields and an optional parameter; no breaking change.

## 0.7.3

- Correct the `verify.verifications.check` documentation: an already-resolved verification is no longer checkable and returns a 404, not a result with `success: false`. Documentation only; no API or behavior change.

## 0.7.2

- WhatsApp failure detail now carries `meta_error_code`, the raw error code from the WhatsApp Cloud API, and a fuller `description` sourced from Meta's error details. Additive response fields; no breaking change.

## 0.7.1

- Correct the error-code names shown in preview-feature field descriptions (regenerated from the API spec). Documentation only; no API or behavior change.

## 0.7.0

- Add the Verify product: `verify.verifications.create` sends a one-time passcode to a recipient and `verify.verifications.check` validates the code they submit.

## 0.6.0

- Add the WhatsApp channel: `whatsapp.send`, `.get`, `.list`, `.listEvents`. Add WhatsApp templates (read-only): `whatsappTemplates.list`.

## 0.5.0

- Remove the email templates collection (`emailTemplates.create`, `.get`, `.update`, `.delete`, `.publish`, `.list`, `.listVersions`, `.getVersion`), added in 0.3.0. Template management is no longer part of the public API. Sending a published template with `email.send` (pass `template` as an `emt_…` ID or name handle) is unchanged.

## 0.4.2

- Fix the package entry points so the SDK is importable: the build emits `dist/index.mjs`/`.d.mts`, but `main`/`types`/`exports` still pointed at `dist/index.js`/`.d.ts`, so 0.4.0 and 0.4.1 failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. 0.4.1 is deprecated; use 0.4.2.

## 0.4.1

- Build determinism: commit a lockfile and install it frozen so the published build is reproducible (0.4.0 failed to publish on a non-deterministic dependency resolution). Ship the caller-detection test fixtures inside the package so they resolve in the standalone build.
- Correct the `audiences.listContacts` example: a member's contact is `member.contact.id`, with `member.joined_at`.

## 0.4.0

- Add the contacts collection: `contacts.create`, `.get`, `.list`, `.update`, `.delete`, and `.batch` (bulk upsert by email). Requires an API key with the `email_marketing` scope.
- Add the audiences collection: `audiences.create`, `.get`, `.list`, `.update`, `.delete`, plus membership `.listContacts`, `.addContacts`, `.removeContacts`, `.removeContact`.
- Add contact properties: `contactProperties.create`, `.get`, `.list`, `.update`, `.archive`, `.unarchive`.

## 0.3.0

- Add the SMS channel: `sms.send`, `sms.sendBatch`, `sms.get`, `sms.list`.
- Add SMS templates (read-only): `smsTemplates.list`, `smsTemplates.get`.
- Add email templates: `emailTemplates.create`, `.get`, `.update`, `.delete`, `.publish`, `.list`, plus versions `.listVersions` and `.getVersion`.
- `email.send` can send a published template: pass `template` (an `emt_…` ID or name handle) with `parameters` in place of inline `subject`/`html`/`text`.

## 0.2.2

- Rename the anonymous client-identity headers from `X-Bird-Surface`/`X-Bird-Version` to `Bird-Surface`/`Bird-Version` (the `X-` prefix is deprecated, RFC 6648). Same telemetry, new header names; no other behavior or API-surface change.

## 0.2.1

- Send anonymous `X-Bird-Surface` and `X-Bird-Version` client-identity headers on every request, so Bird can attribute API usage by surface. No personal data, credentials, or request content: just which Bird client. Edge-safe (no runtime/OS detection); telemetry only, no behavior or API-surface change.

## 0.2.0

- Add batch email send: `email.sendBatch`.
- Point package metadata at the docs (https://bird.com/docs/sdks/typescript).

## 0.1.1

- Documentation and package-metadata fixes.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release: email send, webhook verification, pagination, typed errors.
